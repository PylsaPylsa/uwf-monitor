# uwf-monitor
Adds an icon to the notification tray to display current Unified Write Filter (UWF) status.
The notification icon can be used as a shortcut to launch the uwf-manager executable.

Created in Visual Studio using Visual C++ with Windows Forms.

The UWF Feature must be installed and a protected volume must be set up (tested with default volume c:) in order for this application to work correctly.
